# FilamentDryer KiCad

This is my first ever PCB design, nothing too interesting.

My 3D printer had a moisture problem (Apparently PETG doesn't like humidity that much). The solution to this problem was to put the filament in the oven for a few hours, but I am not dumb enough to put a plastic that can have any number of toxic additives in the same oven I make the food I eat.

Some companies sells filament dryers, the lowest of which was 60€ at the time. After looking around on the Internet I found a [[series of videos|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPKQCZ75Vwg&list=PLU5lZZLWyxXBlUrfcWFHtYylawElMm2N6]] from [[My Tech Fun|https://www.youtube.com/@MyTechFun]] comparing several dryers, the ones at the lowest prices were surprisingly ineffective and required a lot of DIY to make them more efficient.

So I decided to make everything myself, making sure my dryer was working where the other ones wouldn't. The whole BOM was to be around 70€, which was good enough. It even had extruded polystyrene for thermal isolation !

Ultimatly, putting my filament in an IKEA 10.6L 365+ with a layer of silica gel at the bottom solved the moisture issue and this project only served for me to learn how to make and order PCBs using KiCad and [[JLCPCB|https://jlcpcb.com/]], which is a very useful skill for my other future projects. Maybe one day I'll properly finish it, especially if I ever buy polyamide filaments.
